Build a fully responsive, dark-themed portfolio landing page for Shahbaz Khan, a Web Developer & Technical SEO Specialist. Use the attached resume data and photo. Make it scrollable, interactive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile views.

💻 UI & Design Specifications
General Theme:

Dark background with smooth scrolling effects and blurred, layered animations (inspired by GitHub and Vercel).

Use Apple iOS 16–26 glassmorphism/liquid glass style — ideally with SVG (for better performance and realism).

Subtle parallax or background gradient movement during scroll.

Use modern fonts like SF Pro, Inter, or system-ui.

Responsiveness:

Fully responsive on:

Desktop (1440px+)

Tablets (768–1024px)

Mobile (320–768px)

Use flexbox/grid and media queries to adapt layout.

Ensure buttons, nav, and text remain tap-friendly and readable.
